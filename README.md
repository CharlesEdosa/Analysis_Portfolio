# Analysis_Portfolio
## Portfolio showcasing data analysis and visualization. 
The portfolio comprises a range of data analysis projects. Each report provides a detailed account of the analytical tools and methodologies employed to derive insights, recommendations, and conclusions. The processes of data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visualization are thoroughly documented for each project. Furthermore, the specific research questions addressed in each analysis are clearly articulated within the respective reports.
### Project one (Taylor Swift concert)
The dataset contained information about various concerts held during different tours, including details such as the city and country where the concert took place, the venue, the opening act(s) performing, the attendance (number of tickets sold and available), the revenue generated, and the name of the tour.

### Project two (NYC_AirBnB)
The dataset provided detailed information on Airbnb listings in New York City, covering host profiles, geographical availability, pricing, and listing activity. I began by cleaning the data, removing duplicates, blanks, and outliers to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Using Excel tools such as VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, and other key functions, I was able to answer critical business questions and identify trends related to:

Listing distribution by neighborhood

Host activity and availability and 

Price patterns
