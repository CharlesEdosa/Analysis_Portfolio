# Analysis_Portfolio
## Portfolio showcasing data analysis and visualization. 
The portfolio comprises a range of data analysis projects. Each report provides a detailed account of the analytical tools and methodologies employed to derive insights, recommendations, and conclusions. The processes of data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visualization are thoroughly documented for each project. Furthermore, the specific research questions addressed in each analysis are clearly articulated within the respective reports.

The dataset contained information about various concerts held during different tours, including details such as the city and country where the concert took place, the venue, the opening act(s) performing, the attendance (number of tickets sold and available), the revenue generated, and the name of the tour.

### Project two (NYC_AirBnB)
This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC. The data file included all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, blanks and other outliers that could impact the result of this analysis. The Vlookup function, pivot tables and other excel functions have been utilized to answer key questions.
